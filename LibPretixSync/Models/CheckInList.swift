/// You can create multiple check-in lists to separate multiple parts of your event, for example
/// if you have separate entries for multiple ticket types. Different check-in lists are completely
/// independent: If a ticket shows up on two lists, it is valid once on every list. This might be
/// useful if you run a festival with festival passes that allow access to every or multiple
/// performances as well as tickets only valid for single performances.
